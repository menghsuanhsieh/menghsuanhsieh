I collect some useful probability theory results that are useful in optimal transport.

**Lemma (Ulam).** Let $\mu$ be a Borel, finite measure on $\Omega$. For all $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a compact set $K_{\varepsilon} \subset \Omega$ such that $\mu (K_{\varepsilon}^c) < \varepsilon$.

**Lemma (Compactness in Infinite-Dimensional Spaces).** In a complete metric space $(X,d)$, a closed subset $B$ is compact if and only if it is totally bounded. In other words, $B$ is compact if and only if for all $\varepsilon > 0$, $B$ can be covered by finitely many balls of radius $\varepsilon$.

**Proof of Ulam's Lemma.** By separability, extract a countable dense subset of $\Omega$; denote it $$D \triangleq \{d_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$$. For each $\varepsilon > 0$, it follows that $\Omega = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} B_{\varepsilon}{d_k}$. By continuity of $\mu$, $$\newcommand{\ball}[2]{\mathrm{Ball}_{\textit{#1}}(#2)} \mu(\Omega) = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \mu \left( \bigcup_{k=1}^{n} \ball{$\varepsilon$}{d_k} \right)$$ for all $\varepsilon > 0$.

Pick any $\delta > 0$. It follows from the definition of the limit that, for all $m \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists some $n_m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
	\label{Eq:Compare_Size}
	\newcommand{\ball}[2]{\mathrm{Ball}_{#1}(#2)}
	\mu \left( \bigcup_{k=1}^{n_m} \ball{\frac{1}{m}}{d_k} \right) > \mu(\Omega) - \frac{\delta}{2^m}
\end{align}
$$
Take the $\limsup$ of the closed balls
$$	\newcommand{\ball}[2]{\mathrm{Ball}_{\textit{#1}}(#2)} \{ \overline{\ball{$\frac{1}{m}$}{d_k}} \}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$$; i.e. let
$$
\newcommand{\ball}[2]{\mathrm{Ball}_{\textit{#1}}(#2)}
K \triangleq \bigcap_{m \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup_{k=1}^{n_m} \overline{\ball{$\frac{1}{m}$}{d_k}}.
$$
Then, clearly $K$ is closed. It remains to show $K$ is totally bounded; for every $\varepsilon > 0$, 
$$
\newcommand{\ball}[2]{\mathrm{Ball}_{\textit{#1}}(#2)}
K \subset \bigcup_{k=n_m}^{k} \overline{\ball{$\frac{1}{m}$}{d_k}} \subset \bigcup_{k=1}^{n_m} \ball{$\delta$}{d_k}
$$
if $m > \frac{1}{\delta}$. For $m \leq \frac{1}{\delta}$, $K$ can clearly be covered by finitely many balls. Therefore, $K$ is totally bounded, and by Lemma on **Compactness in Infinite-Dimensional Spaces**, $K$ is compact.

Finally, it follows from direct calculations that

$$
\begin{align*}
	\mu(\Omega \setminus K) &= \mu \left( \bigcup_{m\in \mathbb{N}} \left[ \Omega \setminus \bigcup_{k=1}^{n_m} \overline{B_{\frac{1}{m}}{d_k}} \right] \right) \\
	%
	&\leq \sum_{m \in \mathbb{N}}  \mu \left( \Omega \setminus \bigcup_{k=1}^{n_m} \overline{B_{\frac{1}{m}}{d_k}} \right) \\
	%
	&= \sum_{m \in \mathbb{N}}  \mu \left( \Omega \right) - \mu \left( \bigcup_{k=1}^{n_m} \overline{B_{\frac{1}{m}}{d_k}} \right) \\
	%
	&< \sum_{m \in \mathbb{N}} \frac{\delta}{2^m} = \varepsilon
\end{align*}
$$

where the last inequality follows from \eqref{Eq:Compare_Size}. $\quad \blacksquare$


**Proposition (Borel measures are regular)**. Borel probability measures $\mu$ on $\Omega$ is regular, i.e. outer and inner regularity holds:

$$
	\newcommand{\condset}[4]{\left\{ #1  : \: #2 #3 #4 \right\}}
	\newcommand{\set}[1]{\left\{ #1 \right\}}
	\newcommand{\abs}[1]{\left| #1 \right|}
	\newcommand{\suchthat}{\mathrm{ s.t. }}
	\begin{align*}
	\mu(A) = \sup \condset{\mu(K)}{K \subset A}{}{\text{ is compact}} = \inf \condset{\mu(O)}{A \subset O}{}{\text{ is open}}
	\end{align*}
$$

**Proof**. A stronger version of this theorem is true: every finite Borel measure is regular.
	
I **claim** that finite Borel measure is outer regular if and only if it is inner regular. To see this, suppose Borel measure $\mu : \Omega \to [0,\infty)$ is  regular. Any compact set $K$ is closed, so $\mu(A) = \sup \condset{\mu(K)}{K \subset A}{}{\text{ is closed}}$. Then,

$$
	\begin{align*}
		\mu(\Omega) - \mu(A) &= \mu(A^c) \\
		%
		&= \sup \condset{\mu(K)}{K \subset A^c}{}{\text{ is closed}} 
		%
		= \inf \condset{\mu(F)}{F \subset A^c}{}{\text{ is open}} \\
		%
		&= \mu(\Omega) - \inf \condset{\mu(F)}{A \subset F}{}{\text{ where $F$ is open}} 
	\end{align*}
$$

i.e. $\mu$ is inner regular. The other direction can be shown very similarly.
	
	
I further **claim** that on a Hausdorff space $\Omega$, every tight Borel, finite measure is regular. To see this, note that by Tychonoff's theorem, a family of compact sets is compact in the product topology. So, any tight charge $\mu$ is a measure. Since compactness implies closedness, it follows that for any Borel set $A$,

$$
\begin{align*}
		\mu(X \setminus A) &= \sup \condset{\mu(K)}{K \subset A^c}{}{\text{ is compact}} \\
		%
		&= \sup \condset{\mu(F)}{F \subset A^c}{}{\text{ is closed}}
\end{align*}
$$

i.e. $\mu$ is inner regular, therefore outer regular by the previous claim, therefore regular.
	
	
By the previous two claims, it suffices to prove that every Borel, finite measure on $\Omega$ is tight. Since $\Omega$ is separable, there exists a countable dense sequence ${(x_n)}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$.

Define $C_k^n = \condset{x \in \Omega}{d(x,x_i)}{<}{\frac{1}{n}}$. Then, for all $n$, clearly $X = \bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} C_i^{n}$.
	
Now, fix $\varepsilon  \in (0,1)$. For all $n$, by definition of $C_i^n$, we can find $k = k_n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\mu \left(\Omega \setminus \bigcup_{i =1}^{k} C_i^n  \right) < \frac{\varepsilon}{2^n}$. Denote $C$ as the $\liminf$ of $C_i^n$, i.e.

$$
	\begin{align*}
		C = \bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup_{i =1}^{k} C_i^n 
	\end{align*}
$$

Clearly, $C$ is closed. It is also totally bounded by construction. Therefore, $C$ is compact. It follows by calculation that

$$
	\begin{align*}
		1 - \mu(C) &= \mu \left( X \setminus \bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \bigcup_{i =1}^{k} C_i^n  \right)  = \mu \left( \bigcap_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \left(X \setminus  \bigcup_{i =1}^{k} C_i^n  \right) \right) \\
		%
		&\leq \sum_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \mu \left( X \setminus  \bigcup_{i =1}^{k} C_i^n  \right) %
		\leq \sum_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \frac{\varepsilon}{2^k} = \varepsilon
	\end{align*}
$$

i.e. $\mu(C) \geq 1 - \varepsilon$! Therefore, $\mu$ is tight by Ulam's Lemma. $\quad \blacksquare$


**Theorem (Concentration on $\sigma$-Compact Set)**.
Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $\Omega$ is concentrated on a $\sigma$-compact set if and only if $\mu$ is tight (i.e. Ulam's Lemma holds). Here, concentration on $\sigma$-compact set means there exists a measurable set $S$ that can be written as countable union of compact sets, such that $\mu(S)=1$.


**Proof**. $(\Rightarrow)$ is trivially true: take $K = S$ as described in the theorem, and clearly $\mu(S^c) = 0 < \varepsilon$.
	
$(\Leftarrow)$ Fix $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. Let $K_{\varepsilon} $ be a compact set such that $\mu(K_{\varepsilon}^c) > 1-\varepsilon$. Since $\mu$ is tight, it is regular by an earlier claim, so we have inner approximation of $\mu$ by closed sets for any Borel set $A$.
	
By way of contradiction, suppose $\mu$ is not concentrated on any $\sigma$-compact subset of $\Omega$. Denote $F$ a $\sigma$-compact subset of $\Omega$. Then, there exists some $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ such that 

$$
	\begin{align*}
	\sup \condset{\mu(K_{\varepsilon})}{K_{\varepsilon} \subset F}{}{\text{ is compact}} < \mu(F) - \varepsilon
	\end{align*}
$$

By compactness, $F$ is closed, and since $K_{\varepsilon}$ is compact, $K_{\varepsilon} \cap F$ is compact in $F$ by elementary topology. It follows that

$$
	\begin{align*}
		\mu(K_{\varepsilon}) = \mu(F \cap K_{\varepsilon}) + \mu(F^c \cap K_{\varepsilon}) \leq \mu(F) - \varepsilon + \mu(F^c) = 1-\varepsilon
	\end{align*}
$$

which is a contradiction with the assumption. $\quad \blacksquare$

Here is a very useful result from convex analysis.

**Theorem**. On an arbitrary metric space $(X,d)$, let $F$ be a nonnegative, lower-semicontinuous function on $X$. Then,

$$
		F = \sup \set{\text{increasing sequence of uniformly continuous, nonnegative functions } f}
$$


**Proof**. We proceed constructively. Let

$$
	\begin{align}
		\label{Eq:Construction_Fn_LSC}
		F_n (x) = \inf_{y \in X} F(y) + n d(x,y)
	\end{align}
$$

It remains to check each property stated in the theorem.
	
$\eqref{Eq:Construction_Fn_LSC}$ is clearly nonnegative, as the sum of nonnegative terms. This implies the infimum is nonnegative. Clearly, $\set{F_n}$ is nondecreasing, i.e. $F_{n+1} (x) \geq F_{n}(x)$ for all $n$ and fixed $x$. Finally, the objective in \eqref{Eq:Construction_Fn_LSC} can be bounded as follows:

$$
	\begin{align*}
		\abs{F(y) + n d(x,y)} &\leq \abs{F(y)} + n \abs{d(x,y)} \\
		&\leq \abs{F(y)} + n \Big[ \abs{d(x,z)} + \abs{d(z,y)} \Big]
	\end{align*}
$$

repeating the calculation for $F_n(z)$, then taking the difference, gives

$$
		\abs{F_n (x) - F_n (z)} \leq n \abs{d(x,z)}
$$

i.e. the upper bound is independent of $y$. Take the infimum over all $y \in X$ to recover $F_n (x)$ as defined in \eqref{Eq:Construction_Fn_LSC}. This shows uniform continuity.
	
It remains to show $\sup F_n$ converges to $F$. Fix $\varepsilon > 0$ and $x_0 \in X$. By lower semicontinuity, we have that there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $d(x_0, y) < \delta \implies F(y) > F(x_0) - \varepsilon$. Suppose $d(x_0, y) \geq \delta$. Then, by nonnegativity and $(F_n)$ is increasing, there exists some $N = N_{\varepsilon} \in \mathbb{N}$ large enough such that $F_n (y) + N d(x_0,y) \geq F_n (x_0)$ for all $n \geq N_{\varepsilon}$.
	
Put $\eta \triangleq \inf_{y \in X} F(y) + N d(x_0, y)$, for the choice of $N$ defined above. For this choice of $\eta$, $F(x_0)  \in \ball{$\eta$}{x_0}$. In other words, for all $n > N$, $F_n (x) \in \ball{$\delta$}{x_0}$ for all $x$, implying $F(y) \in \ball{$\delta$}{x_0}$. Therefore,

$$
		\abs{F_n (x_0) - F (x_0)} \leq \abs{F_n (y) + N d(x,y) - F(x_0)} \leq \abs{N \delta} + \abs{F_n (y) - F (x_0)}
$$

where the second term after the second inequality is small by construction. Unfix $x_0 \in X$, and we have the desired convergence result. $\quad \blacksquare$
